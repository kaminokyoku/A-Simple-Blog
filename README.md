Through the web site, users can register for an account, post
articles and to leave comments on others. When logged in, they have full control of the
content they have authored: creating, updating and deleting their content and comments.

Other features:
Administrative interface
An administrative interface is implemented that allows an administrative user to:
1. Add and remove users
2. Reset user passwords, by sending the corresponding user an email with a link to
reset their password
3. Show and hide comments and articles

User interface
Provide the following improvements to the website’s user
experience:
1. WYSIWYG support for authoring articles
2. Informing new users whether or not their chosen username is already taken - without
the user having to submit a form to find out (using AJAX).
3. Using bootstrap / W3.css to achieve a clean, professional and unique look.

Feature enhancements
Provide the following extra features to users:
1. When creating new accounts, users are verified as human using a Google’s
reCAPTCHA.
2. Users are able to enter a date when authoring an article. The date should
default to the current day, but the user can change this to any valid date (past or
future) they wish. If the user enters a future date, the article shouldn’t be visible until
that date.
3. Users are able to search and sort article lists by article title , username , and
date.
4. Nested comments are supported.
